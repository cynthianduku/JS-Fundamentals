# JS-Fundamentals

This repository contains basic JavaScript scripts for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in the language.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice using `const`, `console.log`, and proper syntax in JavaScript. Each script focuses on a small concept or requirement, building a solid foundation in the language.

## File Descriptions

- **0-javascript_is_amazing.js**  
  A script that prints the message:  
  `JavaScript is amazing`  
  using a constant variable and `console.log`.

## Requirements

- All scripts must be executed using Node.js.
- No usage of `var`; only `const` or `let` is allowed.
- All output must be printed using `console.log(...)`.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

```bash
node 0-javascript_is_amazing.js
